The software compiles on the RPI 2, tested with Arch Linux and
Jessie.

There might be an issue with sound on the RPI. Sound might be a
little stuttering when the wrong buffersizes are selected.

Select buffersizes with "latency=X" in the "ini" file ($HOME/.dab-rpi.ini)
My favorite setting is 4.

After a first run, there will be an "ini" file with settings,
just add a line
latency=4
to test and adapt the value when there is stuttering
